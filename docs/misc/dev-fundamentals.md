# Dev Fundamentals

## Don't read the dictionary
- don't try to memory everything
- know what exists and what you can use
- use google
- learn by using the language
- some words are used more often than others

## Use good comments
- code should be self-explanatory
- comments should be concise and easy to understand
- add when something is complex
- add when something important is going on
- more comments does not mean better code

## Understanding Data Structures
- Good programmer can decide when to use what
- Understand what the trade-offs are

- Dictionaries holds more information than lists
- List just holds index and value

- readability - can you understand code after revisit?
- add good comments
- predictability
- DRY - do not repeat code
